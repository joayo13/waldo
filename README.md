A project to test out backend skills (using firebase) and React.js skills. I tried to focus more on creating a nicer UI, as usually I don't like to spend a lot of time on UI and prefer to focus on the more technical/logical parts of projects. Lots of fun, would like to do more fun projects like these in the future.
